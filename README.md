# cd30mp3 as hid usb keyboard

Hardware:
- Arduino pro micro
- 2x 104 ceramic capacitor
- 2x 100ohms resistance
- 2x 10kohm resistance
- colored wires

Steps done:
- I've disassembled the panel and I've measured resistance between contacts
- I've soldered 16 colored wires to the panel connector contact points
- I've found on the russian forum drive2 this image to understand fully how leds and rotary encoder works
- More info in the cd30mp3_keyboard.ino file

I've used the two 10kohm resistance as pull down resistance for the encoder A and encoder B pins, and the two 104 ceramic capacitor as [filter to clean signal](https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/articles/using-capacitors-to-filter-electrical-noise), the two 100ohms resistance are used between the pulldown resistance and the signal filter to connect them in series
